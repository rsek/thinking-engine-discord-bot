  Description: |-
    You are Those-Filthy-Born, spawned in the hump-backed sky lit only by great black anti-suns and false light.

Claviger: #16
  Description: |-
    The Key Masters wander the universe fathoming the workings of all entryways. Though they’re
    - quite fascinated with simple chests and doors they are most excited by metaphysical and metaphorical barriers. You might find small conclaves of Clavigers camped around the feet of Demon Gates, debating appropriate methods of attack, or building obscure machines of entry.

Exographer: #24
  Description: |-
    Where you come from it’s become quite normal to traverse the Spheres. Idle academics like yourself have even begun to study these more remote reaches of the divine effluvia.

  Description: |-
    Luggers are a servile group by nature, most often found in the service of others, weighed down by loads that would buckle a donkey.

Lonesome Monarch: #34
  Description: |-
    You were the ruler of all you surveyed, a great conqueror, a lawbringer! Unfortunately your horse sped off into the pixie forest, or the court magician ensured you disappeared, or you led a sortie into the stars to put your stamp on them as well. Either way you are now a lost and lonely

    Eaters are immune to mundane ingested poisons.

This does not grant special immunity to any effects the object may possess.

Monkeymonger: #36
  Description: |-
    Life on The Wall is hard. One is never more than a few yards from an endless fall yet those precarious villages still need to eat. This is where you come in with your Edible Monkeys (the
    - distinction is purely for appeal since all monkeys are of course edible). You used to spend days on end dangling your feet off the edge of the world, watching over your chittering livestock while they scampered hither and thither, but there was no future in monkey meat. You wanted much
    - more and so stepped off. Or you fell off. Either way you and some unlucky monkeys are here now and that’s all that matters.

Necromancer: #41
  Description: |-

    Down in Yongardy they do things differently. They respect the Law. Every day there is a queue outside the courts to get a seat to see the latest up and coming barrister defend their case with a metre of steel. The people follow the careers of their favourite solicitors, watch all their cases, collect their portraits, and sneak into the court after hours to dab the patches of blood on white handkerchiefs. In Yongardy, they love the Law.
