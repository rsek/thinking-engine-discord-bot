// If you roll a double 6 while attacking you strike a Mighty Blow, win the exchange, and inflict Double Damage

// If both parties strike a Mighty Blow a spectacular clinch is formed, shattering both Weapons (in the case of beastly claws, tentacles, and so on they will lose 1d6 Stamina instead).

// A roll of double 1s in combat results in the roller losing the exchange and their opponent adding 1 to their Damage Roll. If both parties Fumble they each deal Damage to the other, adding 1 to their Damage Roll.


// might be good to make rolling damage elective
// indeed, weapons can be chosen after seeing the roll result, so this is prob the best choice? hm
